            Hey Guys!
            My name is Ujjval and I made this web application
            to help you keep track of your expenses and keep track of your money.
            You can add money to your account and add expenses to your account.
            You can also see your total amount of money in your account.
            You can also see your total amount of expenses in your account.
            So that you always keep Up!
            I made this project as a final project for my CS50W course by harvard!
        </p>
